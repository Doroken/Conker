# Conker
Discord.js bot with image and text-based commands, music playing, and annoying responses to interrupt your conversations if you say the wrong thing.

Please report issues here: https://github.com/Doroken/Conker/issues


Music script has successfully been migrated to repl.it after ffmpeg support was reintroduced. Everything is now hosted there, and the music script was merged with the main one.
