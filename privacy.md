# NO PERSONAL DATA IS COLLECTED/SOLD/ETC!
The only data ever collected is a list of all the servers the bot is in - this includes the name of the server only and nothing else. If you would like to exclude your server name from being returned in the >servers command, please message me in order to opt-out. >server-list is a separate command, where server owners can choose to have their servers listed with more details, and an invite link if they'd like.


## Data Access:

**Read Messages** - Can access messages in this server and read their contents.

Used to react to messages if they contain a keyword, and also used to read legacy commands (commands using > as a prefix). A message is completely ignored if it doesn't match either of these cases.


**Presence** - Can see online status of server members and what they are playing, watching, or listening to.

Used to return activity status information in the >user command.


**Members** - Can see who's in the server and their roles, nicknames, and permission changes.

Used to return roles and server nickname in the >user command.
